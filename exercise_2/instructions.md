# Instructions

- You have cloned this repo down from my personal github. You need to figure out what are the steps you need to do to get it working first, then to create the necessary routes. You will have to install certain tools to use in order to complete these tasks.

## Where are the routes??

- You will have to create routes here that will respond back with some wonderful messages!
- Create a route that will send back the message in string format "Node and express are just lovely"
- Create a route that will render an array of cities. You will include 10 cities from all over the world and the continent on which they are located. The array will follow this format:
  -- [{cityName: "Boston", continent: "North America"}]
  Your render will have the cities show up in an h1 format for the cityName and a p for the continent.
- Create a route that sends back a code 400 and the error message "This is an invalid route"
- Create a route that sends back an object containing your name, city and state.
- Create a route that will render a new html page different from the one above that will show a list of your top 5 movies. Format will be an array [{movieName: "The Shining", poster: "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/21/09/the-shining-2.jpg?width=1200"}]. Please include a working link to a picture and make sure the picture is showing up properly with the movie title. Size them so they are not terribly huge (in other words, STYLE THEM). Include 5 movies.
